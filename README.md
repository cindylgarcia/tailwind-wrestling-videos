# Purpose of This Landing Page

This landing page is a mockup for an application I am building. It is going to be 
an app to train wrestling referees. The app will have videos that will have a breakdown 
of the move and then on the bottom of the videos there will be a link to the pdf explaining the rules application. 

# Architecture For Application
The application will be built on Drupal 10 and deployed on Pantheon. The information 
architecture will used a schema model for the data structures. Content types shall be 
created based on the most common scenarios seen in a wrestling match. The nodes
will have different videos with a pdf file attached that describes the rule that should
be applied to the situation.
